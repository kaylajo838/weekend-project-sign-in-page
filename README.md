# weekend-project-sign-in-page
Group project with Kayla, John, and Anifa.<br />
<br />
Kayla was responsible for the background and the left side of the page. I also took the role as the host,<br />
so I was responsible for making sure all of our codes were properly merged and that they all worked together properly.<br />
<br />
John was responsible for making the form, including the sign in button. He added the icons to the inside of the form boxes.<br />
This allowed John to get more exposure to forms, and taught us both how to add the icons inside of the input boxes.<br />
We also learned what text-indent was, and was able to apply that to the input boxes.<br />
<br />
Anifa was responsible for the footer text and icons.<br />
This allowed more exposure for Anifa to practice with a footer-like element on a webpage.<br />
She also wrapped hers and John's containers together so that it better flowed with the page.<br />
<br />
This project as a group taught us how to all work together and keep communications open.<br />
We worked extremely well as a team, and we all divided our assignments up to places we had more weaknesses in.<br />
This allowed us practice and exposure to those struggle areas.<br />
